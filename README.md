# GTPS2ModelTool

A tool that allows creating **custom models** for Gran Turismo 3. Still in early stages and may break.

For usage documentation, refer to the [Modding Hub](https://nenkai.github.io/gt-modding-hub/ps2/models/).

## Details

There is some code for GT4 (as the codebase essentially works for both games) but still needs heavy work.

Requires **.NET 6.0** to build.
