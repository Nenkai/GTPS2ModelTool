# GTPS2ModelTool

*As seen on [Lifting the Bonnet on Gran Turismo's Model Format](https://nenkai.github.io/gt-modding-hub/blog/2023/11/26/lifting-bonnet-on-gt-models/)*

---

A tool that allows creating **custom models** for Gran Turismo 3. Still in early stages and may break.

For usage documentation, refer to the [Modding Hub](https://nenkai.github.io/gt-modding-hub/ps2/models/).

## Current Tasks

I am slowly retiring from GT research, but here are the current tasks left to be done

* Tex1 Optimizations - heavily needed
* Properly support reflective meshes?
* Support for Tex1/Material patches for multi-color car support
* More GT3 callbacks support
* GT4 VM support?

---

## Details

There is some code for GT4 (as the codebase essentially works for both games) but still needs heavy work.

Requires **.NET 6.0** to build.
